# i18next-Presentation

## Introduction (i18n)
Internationalization i18n is the process of preparing software so that it can support local languages and cultural settings. An internationalized product supports the requirements of local markets around the world, functioning more appropriately based on local norms and better meeting in-country user expectations.  
I18n is often misrepresented as Localization (L10n) and sometimes even Translation. I18n is product development focused so that in the case of software, one code base is made capable of supporting worldwide languages and locale-specific formatting and behaviors. Conversely, Localization makes a product specific to a target market or region(s), including translation of the interface and possible adaptation of terminologies and more.
