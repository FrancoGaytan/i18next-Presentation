## Introduction (i18n)
Internationalization i18n is the process of preparing software so that it can support local languages and cultural settings. An internationalized product supports the requirements of local markets around the world, functioning more appropriately based on local norms and better meeting in-country user expectations.  
I18n is often misrepresented as Localization (L10n) and sometimes even Translation. I18n is product development focused so that in the case of software, one code base is made capable of supporting worldwide languages and locale-specific formatting and behaviors. Conversely, Localization makes a product specific to a target market or region(s), including translation of the interface and possible adaptation of terminologies and more.  

### So what does software i18n involve?  
Typical software internationalization tasks include:  
* Developing software to be independent from a specific language.
* Locale Frameworks.
* Achieving Unicode compliance.
* Elimination of hard-coded text (strings) in the code.
* Removal and reworking of concatenated strings.
* Support for collation of data.
* Support for bi-directional languages.
* Plus more, including issues that may be application and market specific.  

### Benefits of internationalizaing software:  
Benefits of software i18n include:  
* Higher quality software that meets the technical and cultural needs of multiple locales.
* Reduced time, cost, and effort for localization.
* Single source code for all languages of the product.
* Simpler, easier maintenance for future iterations of the product.
* Greater in-country customer acceptance and satisfaction.

Perfect, now that weÂ´ve covered the basics of the internalization process we can start talking about the way that React implements it with our main topic.
